TODO:
*b = bug, *f = feature

*b enemies not following laser
*f make force shield (lasts a few seconds, player.deltaInvisFrames = forceShieldTimeUp, bullets reflect back and flip bool harmfulToPlayer)

DONE:
/*b player getting hit by unknown thing, seems to be after 2nd pair of spawners enabled - enemies were tagged with player and getting hit by their own bullets
/*b enemies in alleyway getting stuck on invisible wall
/*f add 1up drops
/*f finish laser beam
/*b player no longer getting hit
/*b only one pair of spawners are acting at a time (always new ones); unity shows old ones still active - just got rid of maxSpawnable check... this is 1000 cats
/*b bullets not dying when coming in contact with enemies - added Destroy(other.gameObject) in enemy's check
